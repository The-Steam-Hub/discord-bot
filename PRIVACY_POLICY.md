By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please discontinue use of the Bot.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Effective Date.” Your continued use of the Bot after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
